# detroit-crime-analysis

Crime concentrates in hotspots due to offender routines, target availability, and neighborhood characteristics. Analysis uses density mapping, clustering (KDE, DBSCAN), and spatial regression to identify patterns. Time series models (SARIMA, LSTM) predict future crime for resource allocation, evaluated via RMSE, PAI, and stability metrics.
